# ðŸ“Š SQL Sales Analysis â€” Query Explanations

This markdown explains the SQL logic behind each question in the `queries_and_solutions.ipynb` file. The goal is to **help you understand why the queries work**, not just copy them.

### Question 1: Retrieve All Orders by Bianca

**SQL:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sales WHERE Customer = 'Bianca';
Explanation:

We use SELECT * to fetch all columns from the Sales table.

WHERE Customer = 'Bianca' filters the rows to only include orders made by Bianca.


âœ… Question 2: Total Quantities Sold Per Product
SQL:
SELECT ProductName, SUM(Quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM Sales
GROUP BY ProductName;

Explanation:
SUM(Quantity) adds all quantities sold for each product.

GROUP BY ProductName ensures the sum is calculated per product.

The alias total_quantity is required to match test expectations.


âœ… Question 3: Total Quantity Sold in January 2024
SQL:
SELECT SUM(Quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM Sales
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31';

Explanation:
BETWEEN filters the date range from Jan 1 to Jan 31.

SUM(Quantity) totals the units sold within that period.


âœ… Question 4: Calculate Average Unit Price
SQL:
SELECT AVG(UnitPrice) AS average_price
FROM Sales;

Explanation:
AVG(UnitPrice) calculates the mean price of all items sold.

AS average_price gives the result a readable alias.


âœ… Question 5: Customers with More Than 2 Orders
SQL:
SELECT Customer, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Customer
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;

Explanation:
GROUP BY Customer groups sales by each customer.

COUNT(*) counts how many orders each customer made.

HAVING COUNT(*) > 2 filters the result to customers with more than two orders.

We use HAVING instead of WHERE because it works with aggregates like COUNT().
